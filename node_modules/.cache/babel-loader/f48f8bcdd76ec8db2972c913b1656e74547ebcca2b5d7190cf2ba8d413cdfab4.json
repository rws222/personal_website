My group and I decided to create a website that would determine the user's optimal investment portfolio from a list of S&P 500 stocks, popular ETFs, and a risk-free asset (10-year T-bonds) by having them complete a risk aversion assessment. The assessment results in a numeric answer which is then scaled to a reasonable risk aversion variable. We then use a quadratic utility function along with the assessment-determined risk aversion variable to calculate and plot the optimal makeup of this user's investment portfolio. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The original website was a Flask project that was hosted on Heroku. After the free tier of Heroku was eliminated, our Professor, Dr. Don Bowen, created a new version on Streamlit which uses our original code on a new interface. He also added the ability to specify the maximum leverage the user is willing to take on as well as the option to customize the securities in the portfolio.
