The k-opt algorithm involves a repeated set of heuristics that reverse sections of a path if doing so would improve the total distance. In Dr. Bentley\\u2019s algorithm, this runs about 250 times. It repeats the overall process four times by generating a new random tour from random starting cities and takes the best iteration as its result. By this design, we were able to rewrite Dr. Bentley's algorithm to run each tour in parallel. We also were able to run the k-opt heuristics in parallel by giving each thread an equal section of the 250 iterations. We ran into a race condition where two or more threads could attempt to write their own best path simultaneously, but we solved this simply by adding a single lock to the results file. It would rarely cause waiting since it is infrequently written to. With Dr. Bentley\\u2019s k-opt algorithm, we were able to achieve a speedup of about 7 using 8 threads.

The brute force TSP algorithm, which calculates the total distance of every possible order of cities, follows what we call an <i>O(n!)</i> time complexity, which means that its execution time scales by a factor of <i>n!</i> for each additional city. For example, if it takes 2 seconds to solve for 2 cities (<i>2!</i>) and 6 seconds for 3 cities (<i>3!</i>), it would take 3,628,800 seconds (42 days) to solve for just 10 cities (<i>10!</i>). In practice, a computer would be much faster than 2 or 6 seconds for such a small number of cities, but this example still highlights the inefficiency of the TSP brute force algorithm for a greater number of cities. If a delivery driver must make 300 deliveries in a day, using such an algorithm to find the most efficient route is highly impractical. Therefore, we wanted to see what optimizations we could make to improve the runtime of TSP algorithms. \n        </p>\n        <h3>Inspiration</h3>\n        <p>\n          In my senior-year algorithms class, we had a guest lecture from Dr. Jon Bentley, a former professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former researcher at Bell Laboratories. His lecture focused on practical ways to make algorithms more efficient, and he used the TSP as his example. He walked us through both his optimized brute force TSP algorithm as well as a nondeterministic approximation algorithm (k-opt) for TSP, which resulted in a much faster runtime while still providing a near-optimal solution.  \n        </p>\n        <h3>Our Project</h3>\n        <p>\n        For our project, we set out to apply our parallel programming knowledge to three TSP algorithms - our own brute force, Dr. Bentley's optimized TSP, and Dr. Bentley's k-opt. While we achieved some minor speedup of the brute force algorithm and Dr. Bentley's optimized algorithm using vector instructions, our biggest achievement was with his k-opt algorithm. The k-opt algorithm involves a repeated set of heuristics that reverse sections of a path if doing so would improve the total distance. In Dr. Bentley’s algorithm, this runs about 250 times. It repeats the overall process four times by generating a new random tour from random starting cities and takes the best iteration as its result. By this design, we were able to rewrite Dr. Bentley's algorithm to run each tour in parallel. We also were able to run the k-opt heuristics in parallel by giving each thread an equal section of the 250 iterations. We ran into a race condition where two or more threads could attempt to write their own best path simultaneously, but we solved this simply by adding a single lock to the results file. It would rarely cause waiting since it is infrequently written to. With Dr. Bentley’s k-opt algorithm, we were able to achieve a speedup of about 7 using 8 threads. We tested it using more, but had significantly diminishing returns, if any. \n        </p>\n      </Card>\n      <Card \n        image={Truman}\n        alt='Truman Platform'\n        title='Truman Project'\n        subtitle='Summer 2022, Fall 2021'\n        description=\"At Lehigh, I completed two independent study (research) courses - one \n          during my senior year and the other for my graduate study.

Just like other social media sites, when a valid hashtag is recognized, it is added as a link in the post. I also implemented a route in the backend that filters posts by a queried hashtag, so when the user clicks a hashtag, they only see posts with that same hashtag.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For my graduate independent study, my task was to develop a script that would automatically generate content for the Truman Project. Prior to my work, all content had to be manually created. The goal of my project was to make the process of generating content significantly easier. I took this project on as a way for me to begin exploring applications of machine learning - a topic I would explore more thoroughly in the following semesters. I also wanted to use free APIs only, and the best one for natural text generation I could find at the time was GPT-Neo, an open-source API from OpenAI, who were only a few months away from releasing ChatGPT. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n          My content generation script was written in Python. It allowed for a few variables and parameters to be set by the user to produce the desired result. To allow for some choice in the type of content generated, the user would enter the name of any subreddit community. The script would get the most popular posts of the day from that subreddit and then generate similar posts. I then had it use a free commercial image API to find a picture related to the newly generated text for each post. To complete each post, I had it generate a username of the author, a timestamp, and a few other attributes required by the Truman Project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The result was very useful in generating realistic content for a social media platform, eliminating the need to write each post manually from scratch.
