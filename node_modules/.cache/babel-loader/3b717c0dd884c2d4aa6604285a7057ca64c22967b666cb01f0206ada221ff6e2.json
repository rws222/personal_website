The rider could press a button to activate the blue LED, which would start blinking on and off as added visibility at night or in harsh weather conditions. \n        </p>\n        <div className='Projects-modal-img-wrapper'>\n          <img className='Projects-modal-img' alt='Smart Bike diagram' src={bike1} />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          The other aspect of our bike was the rear-view system. The feed from the camera mounted below the bicycle seat would display on the monitor between the handlebars. The rider could use this as a way to easily check what was behind them. For added visibility, we used OpenCV, a computer vision library, to graphically highlight objects on the screen, making it more obvious to the rider when something was behind them.  \n        </p>\n        <div className='Projects-modal-img-wrapper'>\n          <img className='Projects-modal-img' alt='Smart Bike diagram' src={bike3} />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Overall, our Senior Lab professors were happy with our work and appreciated our goal of using technology to improve rider safety.

Local professionals with special needs teaching experience assisted us in figuring out the logistics of hosting such a program, including teaching methods, transportation, and safety. We established a relationship with an organization that develops VR lessons for special needs individuals. For example, some of their lessons involve virtually guiding the user through grocery shopping, crossing the street, and joining a conversation. We designed a business model and plan a to implement our curriculum that included our market research, finances, safety, partnerships, and overall viability all backed by our interviews with technology and education professionals. Finally, we presented our plan to the community center's board of directors, who showed great enthusiasm for our project. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This project was immensely rewarding both personally and educationally, given our target audience and the experience it offered into conducting proper research, making a thorough and realistic business plan, forming professional relationships, and delivering a final product. \n        </p>\n      </Card>\n      <Card \n        image={blackjack}\n        alt='Playing cards'\n        title='Blackjack Web App'\n        subtitle='January 2021 - December 2021'\n        description={`As part of my Web Systems Programming course in the fall semester \n        of 2020, my classmates and I were tasked with building a Blackjack web application. \n        The assignment was a test of our understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and \n        required us to use a Deck of Cards API to manage the deck, animations for the \n        cards, and an opponent that operated based on a set of rules given by the professor. \n        Play the game using the link below.
